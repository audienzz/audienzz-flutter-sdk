# Clickstream analytics contract

The cross-platform contract is maintained in
[audienzz-android-sdk/docs/analytics-contract.md](https://github.com/audienzz/audienzz-android-sdk/blob/feature/page-impression-api/docs/analytics-contract.md).

Current branch additions: top-level `publisher_id`, `environment`, `os_version`; company/website
mapping moves to the collector; plain-decimal CPM with source-specific currency; unknown IDs
omitted; iOS impressions guarded per creative. Stock Prebid iOS cannot expose exact bid economics,
so those fields remain absent. Attribute values remain JSON strings.

New native SDK releases must ship before updating bridge pins. Dart/JS updates alone do not apply
native analytics fixes. See the contract for page-impression ownership, immediate durable delivery,
legacy payload handling and outstanding client/backend checks.
